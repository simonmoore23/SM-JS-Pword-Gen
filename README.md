# SM-JS-Pword-Gen

- Everytime I log onto a new website, I am asked for a username and password. I wanted to create a site that would generate these new passwords for me
- I built this site as a resource for creating random passwords
- Using the same password over and over can catch you out if one site isn't as secure as others. Giving up the info would give hackers 
access to all logins and creating alternative passwords would mitigate this risk.
- I learnt a lot about JavaScript but I feel I have much more to learn.
What makes your project stand out? I'm not sure if this project stands out for others but it's something I can use and share with friends and family. <img width="1240" alt="Screenshot 2023-10-19 at 22 59 22" src="https://github.com/simonmoore23/SM-JS-Pword-Gen/assets/145996367/72987e0b-246a-423a-b335-d44c303a5080">
